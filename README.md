## Election Audit Summary
This script can be used for any election as long as the script is modified to match the data we are looking to analyze.
For example, we could use this script for a national election by modifying the code so that it tracks the voter's state as well as their county.
For a national election, we could also add a variable similar to the "largestCounty" variable to track which states had the largest voter turnout.
